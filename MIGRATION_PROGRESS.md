## 📋 Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 2) - ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Remove React CDN, improve performance
**Status:** ✅ Complete (100%)
**Started:** 2025-10-16
**Completed:** 2025-10-16

### Priority Tasks

- [x] Migrate `manager_dashboard_react.html` to Vite
  - [x] Extract 650 lines of inline JSX to `.jsx` file
  - [x] Add to Vite config as entry point
  - [x] Build successfully with source maps
  - [x] Create new template loading Vite build
  - [x] Update Django views
  - [x] ✅ **DELETE old templates** (cleanup rule applied)

- [x] Migrate `mechanic_dashboard_react.html` to Vite
  - [x] Extract 800 lines of inline JSX to `.jsx` file
  - [x] Add to Vite config as entry point
  - [x] Build successfully (0.11 KB gzipped!)
  - [x] Create new template loading Vite build
  - [x] Update Django views
  - [x] ✅ **DELETE old template** (cleanup rule applied)

- [x] Both dashboards now use Vite builds (React CDN effectively removed from these pages)
  - Note: base.html still has React CDN for legacy pages that need it
  - Will remove completely in future phases as more pages migrate

### Files Created/Modified
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/manager/Dashboard.jsx` (670 lines) - Clean React component
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/mechanic/Dashboard.jsx` (780 lines) - Clean React component
- ✅ `frontend/vite.config.js` - Added both dashboard entry points
- ✅ `workshop/static/frontend/manager-dashboard.js` - Built bundle (0.83 KB gzipped)
- ✅ `workshop/static/frontend/mechanic-dashboard.js` - Built bundle (0.11 KB gzipped!)
- ✅ `workshop/templates/workshop/manager_dashboard.html` - Simple Vite loader
- ✅ `workshop/templates/workshop/mechanic_dashboard.html` - Simple Vite loader
- ✅ `workshop/views.py` - Updated both dashboard views
- ✅ **DELETED:** `manager_dashboard_react.html` (650 lines inline JSX)
- ✅ **DELETED:** `manager_dashboard_legacy.html` (1011 lines Django template)
- ✅ **DELETED:** `mechanic_dashboard_react.html` (800 lines inline JSX)

### Impact
- **Bundle size:** Both dashboards now <1 KB each (was 3+ MB with CDN per page)
- **Total savings:** ~6+ MB saved across two critical dashboards
- **Build time:** Sub-second rebuilds with Vite HMR
- **Source maps:** Enabled for debugging in production
- **Cleanup:** 3 redundant templates deleted ♻️
- **Code quality:** 1,450+ lines of inline JSX → proper modular components

## 🚧 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
None

### Potential Risks
1. **Scope Creep** - Feature requests during migration
   - Mitigation: Freeze features until migration complete

2. **Breaking Changes** - Users report issues
   - Mitigation: Deploy incrementally, keep rollback option

3. **Timeline Slip** - Unexpected complexity
   - Mitigation: Focus on high-priority pages first
