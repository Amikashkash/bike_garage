# 🎯 Frontend Migration Plan: Django to Modern React

**Project:** Bike Garage Management System
**Start Date:** 2025-10-16
**Estimated Completion:** 12 weeks
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## 📋 Overview

Migrating from messy hybrid architecture (Django templates + React CDN + Vite React) to clean, unified React SPA with Tailwind CSS.

**Current State:**
- 23 Pure Django templates
- 4 React CDN templates (3MB+ unoptimized JS)
- 5 Modern Vite React components
- 3 competing styling systems

**Target State:**
- 100% Modern React SPA
- Single Vite build pipeline
- Tailwind CSS only
- Consistent patterns and architecture

---

## 🚀 Migration Strategy

Using **"Strangler Fig Pattern"** - gradually replace old code with new while keeping site online.

```
Old (Django) ──→ New (React SPA)
       ↓              ↑
   Gradual Migration
```
